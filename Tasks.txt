85: Is 'req.session = null' correct?
    What about 'res.end(req.session.views + ' views')
    })' ?
    What's sessions.sig?

147: Do I need to include the !== undefined condition?
     Was that just an unsuccessful attempt at fixing that bug (where I actually just needed to add templateVars)?

156: Do I need var errors?

If I'm logged in and I manually go to the registraiton page, I get an error saying it can't read property userID of undefined. Is that ok or not?

/register page still shows the register link from the not logged in version of the header.
