85: Is 'req.session = null' correct?
    What about 'res.end(req.session.views + ' views')
    })' ?
    What's sessions.sig?

147: Do I need to include the !== undefined condition?
     Was that just an unsuccessful attempt at fixing that bug (where I actually just needed to add templateVars)?

156: Do I need var errors?

If I'm logged in and I manually go to the registraiton page, I get an error saying it can't read property userID of undefined. Is that ok or not?

/register page still shows the register link from the not logged in version of the header.

Check out all pages that use error messages.
Should the messages be more specific?
Should I make more error pages?

Typing the deleting address takes me nowhere.
It's because there's no app.get("urls/:id/delete")

/login only checking email.
Should also be checking passwords with bcrypt hash.
